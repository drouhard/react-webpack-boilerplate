# Boilerplate for React and Webpack

Get started faster.

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/drouhard/react-webpack-boilerplate`
2. `cd react-webpack-boilerplate`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run build`

## Usage
Webpack will build from src/ and produce javascript in dist/. CopyWebpackPlugin will also copy over index.html and the whole css directory. Use `npm run webpack` during development for file watching, and `npm run build` as a one-off.
